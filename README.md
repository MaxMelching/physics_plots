# physics_plots

## Description
This repository is a collection of scripts that generate plots, which I wrote
and used throughout my physics studies at Leibniz University Hannover.


* `AI_trajectories.py`: script to generate the trajectories of freely falling
atoms in an atom interferometer. Produces plots like ![](pictures/ai_trajec.png)

* `sampling.py`: script to sample from arbitrary probability distributions.
